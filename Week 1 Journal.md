# Journal for week 1
In week 1 of this course, we got to know more information about how the course works, how to work on assignments, etc. We are also given 3 hypothetical case studies from which we are asked to pick one. During the class, I have decided to form a group with 3 other friends along with whom I did projects for other courses. After studying the case scenarios released by the unit coordinator, we have decided to work on the Medical Data Sharing website because the timing at which we could do it cannot be any better (the pandemic, contact tracing and vaccine rollout).
