# Week 7

- I have spent this entire week trying to learn about Microsoft Azure. I have watched the video tutorials about Azure from on this YouTube video. It was over 8 hours long and covered a large part of Azure. I completed the entire video in this week and practiced creating different types of resources on the cloud in order to understand how they work. In this week, I experimented with the following items on Azure, 


    - Azure Bastion
    - Azure Network Security Groups
    - Azure Compute VM (both Linux and Windows)
    - Azure scale sets (Linux only) with automatic scale in or scale outs
    - Azure Firewall, Virtual network, public IP addresses, etc. 
    - SQL and NoSQL databases on Azure

- In this week portfolio is not updated every day even after working because no meaningful tasks related to the project are accomplished in this week. Most of the time is dedicated to learning and practicing the concepts taught in the tutorial video.
