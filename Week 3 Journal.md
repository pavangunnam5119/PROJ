# Journal for week 3

In this week we prepared a statement of work in we documented the mission statement, project deliverables and listed the tasks that are in-scope and the tasks that are not in scope. We have decided to leave any software development work related to website or databases out of scope because the main goal of the project is to design network architecture and it has nothing to do with web development. In this week, we also created Work-Breakdown structure, Gantt chart and RACI table for the project. 

According to the RACI, I was meant to work on the following topics between week 1 to week 4. 
- Discuss the issues MDS may face in their current architecture
- Discuss the approach we should take to design a new network
- Create a set of requirements that the new architecture must satisfy.
