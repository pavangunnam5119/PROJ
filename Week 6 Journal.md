On this day, I started formally documenting my research findings in a word document. No additional study was done on that day. The next day, I presented my findings to my teammates and we made the decision to use Azure as the provider because works well with enterprises

On this day, our CISO was designing the security policies for MDS. I helped him with the design of password policy. We have decided to the following rules in the password policy,
- Passwords should be longer than 10 characters
- They should have at least 1 number, 1 uppercase letter, 1 lower case letter and 1 symbol
- The password must be reset every two months
- The password shouldn’t have the symbols like ‘,”, and ` as they can cause some issues. 
	
Along with that, I also helped him in designing the acceptable use policy. This policy deals with the things that are allowed and not allowed to be done on MDS owned IT equipment. The rules are,
- Not to use computers provided by MDS for personal purposes like opening personal emails, social media, installing malicious or cracked software and inserting unknown USB drives into the computers. 
- The employees should not leave the laptop or PC unlocked and unattended at any time. The employees are also not allowed to add/remove/reinstall the parts in PC or Laptop.
- In case of a physical damage to laptop or PC, the customer should contact the IT support staff as soon as possible and inform them of the situation. Under no circumstances are they allowed to take them to 3rd party computer repair stores without prior approval from the head of IT department of MDS.
