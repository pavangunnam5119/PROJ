# Week 5 
- April 8th 
  
Before starting this project, I didn’t know much about cloud computing. As I was given the task to write about product reviews, I started my work by studying the differences between cloud hosting and on-premise hosting. I have referred to several articles that covered the differences between them and the pros and cons of each type of hosting. Out of all the articles read, this article stood out. On that day, I finally understood the reason why many companies are giving up on-premise data centres and moving to the cloud.

After studying about cloud hosting on the day before yesterday, I have read about the types of cloud. From what I learned, the cloud services can be divided into 3 categories based on the cloud model. The 3 categories are, 
1.	SaaS
2.	PaaS and 
3.	IaaS

I understood that Medical Data Sharing was looking to move their network infrastructure to the cloud. So, they are looking for providers who offer Infrastructure as a Service.  Then I searched for the most popular IaaS providers. I found out that most of the market share is occupied by Amazon, Google and Azure. So, I did extensive research on the benefits of each provider and roughly noted them on a paper. If I was asked to describe each of them in one word, I’d describe them like,

- AWS: Best all-rounder
- Azure: Works best for Enterprises
- GCP: Very innovative and useful for AI/ML
